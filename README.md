# nosh 
A simple shell supporting background tasks.

This shell uses a linked list needed for the ```jobs``` command developed by FAU´s i4.

# Usage

It´s a shell. If you´ve come to comipiling this, I´m expecting you to know how to use one.

- Append ```&``` to any command to have it run in the background. Check background tasks using ```jobs```. 
- ```cd``` supports relative paths.
